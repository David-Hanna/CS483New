// Class to manage Buffers. This isn't strictly needed in our use-cases as all
// it does is delegate through to the buffer classes themselves. However, it's 
// provided as an intermediate step. In a future expansion, you may want to
// store a copy of all buffers created so you can later run through them and
// reload them if, say, your context is lost. This is left as an exercise.
